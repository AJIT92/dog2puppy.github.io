Today I was playing with T-Flip-Fops and i made a pistion door. I will not do a tutorial on it, but I will explain how the T Flip Flop works.

## T-Flip-Flop

The T-Flip-Flop uses hoppers. I'll try to explain it best I can. 

First start with a block and one one side have a redstone torch and on the other a button. Under the torch, make a hopper clock. On the hopper that's not under the torch, put a piece of redstone dust on top. The torch should power it. Now add a comparetor coming out of the redstone dust hopper. You can then link that comparetor to your door.
