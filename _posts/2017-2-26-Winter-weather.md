Recently, I've had some of the wierdest weather. We had about a week of it being in the high 60s and low 70s, and then it went down to freezing. I have all this recorded on a weather station.

I got one of these for my birthday back in October. It's worked perfectly and I look at it's little display multiple times a day. We got our's from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/AcuRite-01057RM-Weather-Environment-Monitoring/dp/B00T0K8MN8/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1488117583&sr=8-5&keywords=acurite+5-in-1+pro+weather+station). It also included a SmartHub and I've used that to look at the weather at school.

This has been useful for sharing weather to weather underground. It's also been usful for looking at the weather at school. It's easy to use and setup in my opinion.
